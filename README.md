Embedded System Game Design
The legend of the axolotl:
This project uses a hashTable as a backing structure for the background and map of the game.
Speaker, pushbuttons, LCD screen, and other circuity make up the backbone of the hardware.
Each hardware piece was imported with a library and pin diagram for the buttons to operate.
Switch statements and methods were used to code the player movement, player interaction,
and speech bubble text for the RPG Game
